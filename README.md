# Omnichan

Here's the Omnichan apk while I sort out the Google Play store issues. I'm pretty sure this has a different signature than the play store version - so you may need to uninstall your existing app. I'll figure out the signing issues in the next release, I believe google changed how signing is done.

The app is free to use, the source code is currently not open source, but I plan to open source it once I clean up some legacy code. This product is distributed as-is, no warranty expressed, don't blame me if it sets your toaster on fire, etc.

Be wary of any APK you get from a source that isn't github, google play, or phobos.one/omnichan/ - I don't monitor those and can't make any promises about them
